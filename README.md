# Waterdip.AI-Backend_Task

This is a repository meant to house my code files related to the Backend Task assigned by 'Waterdip.AI' as a part of their hiring process.

## Steps to Test the App Locally

### Getting started
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Godzilla5111/Waterdip.AI-Backend_Task.git` <br>
2. Change to the repo directory: `cd Waterdip.AI-Backend_Task` <br>
3. If you want to use virtual environment: `conda create --name` 
  <br> To activate the environment : `conda activate --name`
  <br> To deactivate the environment : `conda deactivate` <br>
4. Install dependencies with pip or conda: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install -r requirements.txt` <br>
6. Make sure to activate the environment. Then open the command line and run the app to start the server: `python main.py` <br>
7. Once the app server is up and running, in a separate terminal, navigate to the working directory and run 'tests.py'. It will perform the checks automatically.

P.S. : @team Waterdip AI, I have added the checks for the bonus tasks myself. Please verify it once whether they are correct or not!
